[h1]Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]Placing a marker at the merc's location can be hard to see due to the marc icon being on top.
[*]No ability to add notes.  Recommend using an alternative such as Steam's overlay notes.
[*]No displayed cell number.  Does not show the cell number under the cursor, which could be helpful with creating notes.
